Annectdote about time interacting with infra or choosing DB

## Prerequisites


## Why do we use Databases

If you and a friend want to access the same data in an application, 
or if you want to access the same data again in the future (persistance) such that it's not on your local device you need a database!

Typically a client like a web browser will interact with a web server, 
and that server will interact with a database

Insert image of 2+ clients -> server -> DB

## Objectives of Database
- Fast reads
- Fast wrties
- Persistant and durable data

So what affects these?

Memory and disk HDD and SSD

## HDD OR SSD

TLDR general advice: 
Use hard drives and upgrade RAM memory as needed
Tradeoffs & Considerations
- Slower when we read from disk (but if RAM memory is large enough to hold DB this won't matter)
- We should aim for sequential operations due to physical movement of HDD
- MUCH Cheaper than SSDs

If DB size will exceed 200GB, fine, tell Jerry in infra to get the SSD

Long Version

There are 3 technical factors to consider when chosing between HDD and SDD

1. The size of your db
2. The amount of memory (RAM) you have in the server
3. The distribution of your data usage (is most of your usage over a small subset of your overall
data, or is a large amount of your data stored actually queried)

```tsx
if (server.availableRAM >= database.size) {
    /*
    DB can be held in memory and SSD may be a waste of money 
    since you won't need to read from disk, HDD vs SDD doesn't apply
    */
    UseHDD("Because it's cheaper");
} else if (server.availableRAM < database.size) {
    /*
        You may need to read from disk
    */
    ItDependsOnHowYouUseYourData();
}
```

#### ItDependsOnHowYouUseYourData

If your available memory < database size then you may need to read from disk 
which is when HDD vs SSD actually may matter. This is compounded if you are 
doing complex queries or have many users querying against the database.

However, most of the time people don't access their data equally. If the majority of 
the data you interact is only 20%(pareto principle) of the database then most of the time you can
get away with using less resources and just accept that the infrequent times you use the other 80% 
it will be a bit slower.

That said depending on how you use your data, I'd give 2 different recommendations:

1. If the majority of your data usage is only over a fraction of your data (most people)

I'd suggest first upgrading RAM since that will likely be cheaper and give better results
than changing the drive.
If you know your DB will be very large eg: 200GB+ then it's probably a suitable case to use an SSD

2. If you are often accessing all parts of your data fairly equally 
(read as almost no one, if you don't know if you do or not, odds are you're not)

Same advice as above but lower the threshold from 200GB+ to the size of the RAM you can reasonably upgrade to.



That's it for today, damn this was a long one. If you made it this far, please do comment and show off your new blog. I would really appreciate it!

Thank you for reading!
